/* Limitations of the IF/ELSE expression:
			No ElseIf, so it's A or B.
			Nested IF expressions quickly get out of hand.
CASE expressions allow for easier organization
                can be contained in a SUM or other function
                can evaluate multiple conditions
                are great for pivoting result sets
                can be used in the SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
                not a good idea for JOIN (just do union alls instead)

/* Example #3: CASE in a WHERE clause
/******************************************************/

    Remember how we called this column 'PartyRole'
    in the previous example? Let's put 'PartyRole'
    in the WHERE clause.

    Let's pick up the CASE expression and move it down
    to the WHERE.

    Keep in mind because CASE returns a single value, that's
    only one side of the equation. We then need to specify
    what to compare that output against.

	The end result is that we get only the 'Follower' players
	returned.
